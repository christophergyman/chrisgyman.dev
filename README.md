This is my ✨ personal developement blog ✨ written in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) using [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This website was inspiried by my previous project [🧑‍💻 NoBloat 🧑‍💻](https://github.com/christophergyman/nobloat_website) which was a static HTML CSS and PHP site written without any front end framework.
