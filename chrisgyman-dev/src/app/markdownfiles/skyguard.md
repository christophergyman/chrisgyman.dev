*Open source drone intelligence software, for technological defence purposes.*

## Why?
With the increased use of drones used within all industries in the past 5 years, it is clear that there is applicable use for drones, however safeguard measurements need to be in place to protect against drones from a defence perspective. Alongisde the recent boom of Machine Learning in not only the research but applicable situtations, it is clear that there is a powerful symbiotic relationship between drone and AI.

SkyGuard aims to be a blueprint for hardware that can be attached to any existing drone to add inteligence. 

SkyGuard will attempt to merge AI with a swarm of drones for a multidude of defence applications:
1. UAV Safeguarding Technology
2. Effecient Terrarian Mapping
3. Operator Led Surrvelience Technology

## How?
In order to build SkyGaurd into a company that will aid in Effective Technological Accelerationism we will have to tackle the engineering problems starting with:
1. Operator Hand Detection System (ML Model - Software) 
2. SkyGaurd Sender - Developement Board to send encrypted radio frequencies (Hardware) 
3. SkyGuard Shield - Custom FPV Drone (Hardware)
4. SkyGaurd Reciever - Developement Board to read encrypted radio frequencies (Hardware) 
5. SkyGaurd Connect - Communication between drones and base server (Hardware + Software) 


## How to contribute?
A developement blog will be created and posted which will track the progress of the project. Any open source developers (both hardware and software) are welcome to contribute to this project to help create a better future for all.
